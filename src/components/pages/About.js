            <p>Hi! I am Shojol Shake, a web developer/designer living in Toronto, ON, Canada.
                  I spend my daily life, Design & Developing new websites/Applications using 
                  the most advance web technologies, from Designing (Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, 
                  Adobe Illustrator) and Back end programming and Database – (NodeJS, JIVE and MongoDB, 
                  PostGreSQL, Firebase) to front end engineering – (vanilla JavaScript (ES6), ReactJS, Gatsby, 
                  jQuery, CSS/ScSS, Bootstrap, Restful API, Responsive web design and more), digital 
                  accessibility.

                I love to develop unique and robust web application and my interest for web technology 
                increasing since the day I started working with web technologies. In the past few years I 
                had really good experience working for some great companies like Apple inc. and triabeauty.com, 
                which something pushes me more into making something different.
